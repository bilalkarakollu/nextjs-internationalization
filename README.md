## What is I18n

"I18n" is a common abbreviation for "internationalization." The term is formed by taking the first letter "i," followed by the number "18," and then ending with the letter "n." The number 18 represents the 18 letters between "i" and "n" in the word "internationalization." This abbreviation is often used in software development and localization contexts to refer to the process of designing and adapting software or content to be easily translated and culturally adapted for different languages and regions.

For example, if you are developing a software application and you want to make it available in multiple languages and regions, you would engage in i18n practices to ensure that the software can accommodate different languages, character sets, date formats, and cultural norms without major code changes. This typically involves using localization frameworks, separating text and user interface elements from the code, and providing translation and adaptation resources for different target markets.
